"0","# the first argument must be a numerical vector of data values, In our case it is the 'length' values."
"0","# the secons argument must be a number and is the mean to be tested under the null hypothesis."
"0","# the third argument gives the type of alternative hypothesis and must be one of 'two.sided', 'greater', or 'less'."
